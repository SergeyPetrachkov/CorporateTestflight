# Plan

## Intro
We start from the project overview. Explain the project structure: horizontals and verticals, and what weâ€™ll be working on.
Start with:
* Simple DI, Image Loader, MockFunc, UniFlow.
Then, show the full project.

Make sure Backend runs for everybody, don't forget to `Edit scheme -> Run -> Options -> Use custom working directory and put the CorporateTestflightBackend there`
When it does, git status should show db.sqlite file in the unstaged new files.

## Live coding

Navigate between Plan: {Number} bookmarks to define a problem and solve it together with a group.
